# Notable Health Assessment

## Frontend

### I have used React with Typescript to construct the front-end

### To start project, please run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`

## Backend

### In the interest of time, I have set up the server/database as a json file using the json-server package

### Please use `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000` to run the server

#### P.S. I love Archer too.
